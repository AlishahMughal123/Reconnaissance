# Basic Reconnaissance
Basic recon tools and techniques. 

This is just a very basic script which makes it easier for me to install tools if I change box/server or in case I want to install all the tools on another computer.

Please note this not 100% complete and still needs to be worked on. There is always room for improvements.

## Description

setup.sh installs a bunch of tools you select (from 0-99). I've only added a few tools to install as an example, feel free to make more functions that installs more tools and add it to the switch statement and the menu function.

Recon.sh takes a domain as a parameter which performs subdomain enumeration and puts the output in a text file. This recon step is just a personal preference, change it to whatever you want.

Please read the script for more information, this was made for personal use and its not that great, lots can be improved, but feel free to use.
