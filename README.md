# Basic Reconnaissance
Basic recon tools and techniques

## Description

setup.sh installs a bunch of tools you select from E.G 0-99 and recon.sh takes a domain as a parameter which performs subdomain enumeration and puts the output in a text file. Please read the script for more information, this was made for personal use and its not that great, lots can be improved, but feel free to use.


For the setup.sh script I've only added a few tools to install as an example, feel free to make a function that installs tools and add it to the switch statement and the menu function.
