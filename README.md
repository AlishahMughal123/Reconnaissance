# Basic Reconnaissance
Basic recon tools and techniques

## Description

setup.sh installs a bunch of tools you select from E.G 0-99 and recon.sh takes a domain as a parameter which performs some subdomain enumeration and puts the output in a text file. Please read script for more information, this was made for personal usage and it not great, lots can be improved, but feel free to use.


For the setup.sh script I've only added a few tools to install as an example, feel free to make a functions that installs a tool and add it to the switch statement and the menu function.
